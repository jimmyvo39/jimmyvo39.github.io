							<h2>Todd Gentilcore</h2>
							<p>
								Education consultant
							</p>
							<p> 
								"I was the principal of a high achieving charter school in the South Bronx, and Jimmy worked as my Assessment Specialist. Jimmy is hard working, takes ownership of his development, and is a supportive colleague. <br></br>

As an Assessment Specialist, Jimmy played a vital role in helping to run the school. He ensured over 400 students were properly rostered in all of their classes, managed a staff of over 40 teachers to keep digital gradebooks up to date, and coordinated all of the logistics for assessments from training teachers on proctoring to presenting the exam data clearly in tables and graphs. Managing all of these responsibilities is not easy, and compounding the challenge was that Jimmy had to take this on alone for most of the year because of staffing shortages. Jimmy was able to thrive in the role because he is detail oriented and he is committed to delivering on outcomes.<br></br>

Jimmy grew a lot in the year we worked together, because he took charge of his on the job learning. He began the year as an Assessment Associate, and he was promoted to Assessment Specialist within a year. Jimmy would proactively collaborate with colleagues across other schools to continue to learn more about his role. When Jimmy was confronted with an unfamiliar task, he reached out to whomever he could to determine how to properly complete it. Furthermore, he was receptive to all feedback that I gave him, and he consistently implemented it. His actions showed he took his job seriously, and he worked to grow at it each day. <br></br>

In addition to his hard work and commitment to growth, Jimmy is also a great colleague. All teachers and staff shared how Jimmy’s was a major support to them. Teachers would often Slack Jimmy questions about grade books, report cards, schedules, and a host of other items and Jimmy would always respond to them with a helpful answer in a timely manner. Beyond being helpful, Jimmy also possessed a positive attitude. No matter the stress he was under, he was always laughing with colleagues and ensuring the work environment was a humorous place. <br></br>

Jimmy is a consistent team member who collaborates well with others and commits to grow and succeed on behalf of the enterprise. I recommend him with no reservations. I would also be happy to provide further information about Jimmy."

Working with Jimmy, I felt comfortable and often gave him assignments that were outside of his role. Nevertheless, he executed almost flawlessly at every turn! Next to his skill and work ethic you will find that he is just great human being as well! Jimmy would be an invaluable addition to any organization or team!"

								"It's rare that you come across standout talent like Jimmy. I had the pleasure of working with Jimmy for over two years at Starbucks, where I’ve watched him develop from a Barista into a leadership role as a shift supervisor. Jimmy’s ability to juggle multiple task and responsibilities was unlike any I’ve seen before and made a dramatic difference in the productivity level for our team. No matter how intense our morning rushes were, Jimmy made sure everyone on the team left with a smile. As a team member or a leader, Jimmy earns my highest recommendation."
